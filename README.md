# The-Flying-Horror
Called the Flying Horror purely beacuse of the amount of times I have either started a small fire or burnt myself while building it. This is really my first time playing around with electrical, and this project was a way to challenge myself to learn electrical skills.

A simple Quadcopter with self stabilizing. As quadcopter implies it has 4 arms with a 30a brushless motor and propellers at the end of each arm, with each motor connected to a 30a motor controller. Each controller is then connected to the Power Distribution Board (I only lit on fire one of these bad boys in the process) which also has the 2200mAH battery. I am using a GY-521 gyro/accelerometer to measure the stability of it, of which is connected to an Arduino Uno which is the micro controller I am using.  

The frame was designed by me in Solidworks and then 3d printed and either screwed together using M3 hex screws or super glue.

Not uploading code as of yet because it is still incomplete, this is a project still in the works. I have a lot to learn still, and have already learned a ton.

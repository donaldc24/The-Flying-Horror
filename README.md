# The-Flying-Horror
A simple Quadcopter with self stabilizing. As quadcopter implies it has 4 arms with a 30a brushless motor and propellers at the end of each arm, with each motor connected to a 30a motor controller. Each controller is then connected to the Power Distribution Board (I only lit on fire one of these bad boys in the process) which also has the 2200mAH battery. I am using a GY-521 gyro/accelerometer to measure the stability of it, of which is connected to an Arduino Uno which is the micro controller I am using.
